# Sentiment-Analysis of Twitter Data using Python
This project is done using Python where we collect thousands of tweets using Twython API on a particular topic (for Eg: movies, political issues, sports etc.,). We chose to do sentiment analysis on USA elections as it was the much-debated topic of 2016 "who would be better for USA's Presidency either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? ". We also collected tweets on Bernie Sanders just to compare the sentiments among the three. Text filtering and analysis are done using Python inbuilt libraries.

The system desgin can be represented in the following diagram

The output of analysis shows how much positive, negative and neutral support does the candidates get and compare them to show what percentage of people are happy with the candidate.

The output images produced are:
